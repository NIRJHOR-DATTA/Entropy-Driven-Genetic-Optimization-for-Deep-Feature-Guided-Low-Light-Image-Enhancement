# Entropy-Driven-Genetic-Optimization-for-Deep-Feature-Guided-Low-Light-Image-Enhancement

This repository contains the original implementation of **"Entropy-Driven Genetic Optimization for Deep Feature Guided Low-Light Image Enhancement"**.

---

## ðŸ“š Overview

Our research consists of two major phases:

1. **Unpaired Image Enhancement:**  
   We evaluate how our proposed approach performs on unpaired low-light image datasets.

2. **Generalization with Ground Truth Data:**  
   In this phase, we test how well the **CIDNet** generalizes to other datasets where **ground truth is available**, using the previously trained weights.

## ðŸ’¡ Image Enhancement on Unpaired Datasets

You can test our image enhancement method on various datasets using the provided notebooks:

- **LIME and DICE Datasets**  
  ðŸ‘‰ Run [`LIME-DICE.ipynb`](LIME-DICE.ipynb)

- **MEF Dataset**  
  ðŸ‘‰ Run [`MEF.ipynb`](MEF.ipynb)

- **NPE Dataset**  
  ðŸ‘‰ Run [`NPE.ipynb`](NPE.ipynb)

- **VV Dataset**  
  ðŸ‘‰ Run [`VV.ipynb`](VV.ipynb)
