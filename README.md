# Entropy-Driven-Genetic-Optimization-for-Deep-Feature-Guided-Low-Light-Image-Enhancement

This repository contains the official implementation of  
**"Entropy-Driven Genetic Optimization for Deep Feature Guided Low-Light Image Enhancement"**.

---

## ðŸ“š Overview

Our research consists of two major phases:

1. **Unpaired Image Enhancement:**  
   We evaluate how our proposed approach performs on **unpaired low-light image datasets**.

2. **Generalization with Ground Truth Data:**  
   We test how well the **CIDNet** generalizes to other datasets where **ground truth is available**, using the previously trained weights.

## ðŸ’¡ Image Enhancement on Unpaired Datasets

Run the following notebooks to apply image enhancement on respective datasets:

- **LIME and DICM Datasets**  
  ðŸ‘‰ Run [`LIME-DICM.ipynb`](LIME-DICM.ipynb)

- **MEF Dataset**  
  ðŸ‘‰ Run [`MEF Enhancement.ipynb`](MEF%20Enhancement.ipynb)

- **NPE Dataset**  
  ðŸ‘‰ Run [`NPE Enhancement.ipynb`](NPE%20Enhancement.ipynb)

- **VV Dataset**  
  ðŸ‘‰ Run [`VV_enhancement.ipynb`](VV_enhancement.ipynb)

---

## ðŸ“Š Quality Assessment (BRISQUE & NIQE Scores)

To evaluate the quality of enhanced images using **BRISQUE** and **NIQE**:

ðŸ‘‰ Run [`brisque,niqe.ipynb`](brisque,niqe.ipynb)
